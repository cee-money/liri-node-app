# liri-node-app
Deployed version:

In this assignment, I made LIRI. LIRI is like iPhone's SIRI. However, while SIRI is a Speech Interpretation and Recognition Interface, LIRI is a Language Interpretation and Recognition Interface. LIRI is a command line node app that takes in parameters and gives back data.

LIRI searches Spotify for songs, Bands in Town for concerts, and OMDB for movies.
